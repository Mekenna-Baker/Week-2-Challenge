# Week-2-challenge

## Description

My motivation for this project was to simply combine my newfound HTML and CSS skills. My goal for this project is to be able to add projects to it as I continue to learn, and have a completed portfolio. Creating this project has helped me learn how to make a website responsive, and allowed me to practice with flex-box. 


## Installation

N/A

## Usage

This website is meant to be a portfolio. It is a space to allow the viewer to learn more about me, view projects that I have created, and to be able to reach out to me. Each navigation element should redirect to the corresponding part of the website that the viewer would like to view. Upon clicking on a project, it should redirect you to be able to view the project fully.
